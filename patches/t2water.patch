+<h2><a href="https://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=131984">t2water</a> - Enhanced Water for Thief 2: The Metal Age</h2>
 
-<p>This package contains 32-bit texture replacements for Thief2 water (blue and green). To work properly, the green water requires a modified ddfix.dll, which does not support fog. Use the modified ddfix.dll only with missions that have green water and no fog (Receiving, Eavesdropping, Kidnap, Sabotage). Framed has green water, and it originally has no fog, but if you're using <a href="http://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=131652">t2skies</a>, then it has fog. Precious Cargo has both green water and fog.
