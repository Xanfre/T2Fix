-<li>Backup your *.mis files - or, if you installed t2moon or t2fogskies previously, restore from the backups you should have made.
-<li>Extract this package (with paths) into your Thief2 installation directory. If you've previously installed t2stars or t2moon, some files may need to be overwritten.
-<li>Navigate to the t2skies directory and double-click on t2skies.exe. You will be prompted for
-each patching (type "y" and &lt;enter&gt;).

-<li>EnableFogFix=1
-<li>EnableLifeOfThePartyFogFix=1
-</ul>
-<li>If your ddfix replacement texture path is not the default (RES/ddfix), then move the directory RES/ddfix/t2skies to the correct place (to the directory pointed to by "TexturePath" in ddfix.ini).
-<li>If you installed t2moon previously, the "pmoon" replacement texture directory is now unused and can be removed.
