The legacy executables are provided as a means to play the game if all other
options fail or it is otherwise desired. Using NewDark, if possible, is highly
recommended over using the original executables for most purposes due to its
numerous fixes, added functionality, stability, system compatibility, and many
other factors. Under no circumstances should you attempt to use a
NewDark-dependent feature with the legacy executables, as they will not function
and may cause other issues. The original executables have been delpoyed in such
a manner that they will not interfere with the NewDark-related portions of the
installation.

Unless you are an advanced user, do not modify any of the following files or
directories, as doing so will likely result in catastrophe:
    .\OLDSV
    thief2_no_ddfix.exe
    thief2_ddfix.exe
    oldinst.cfg

Included Executables:
    thief2_no_ddfix.exe - The original Thief 2 1.18 executable as released.
    thief2_ddfix.exe - Thief 2 1.18 with the latest ddfix 1.5.13 applied. See
      ddfix.ini for settings and ddfix README.html for more information.

For both executables, general settings such as screen resolution may be edited
in old.cfg.

Use the provided oldfm.exe program to load fan missions with the original Thief
2 executables. This will invoke the FM Selector, allowing normal selection and
installation of FMs. For an ideal experience, please ensure that the mission is
not NewDark-dependent.
