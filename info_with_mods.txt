Important Notes:

To view the included components, see the following section.

Both the Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable and the DirectX End-User Runtimes must be installed prior to running setup. Most systems should already have these installed, but in the event that they are not, they are available through the links below.

-Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable

-DirectX End-User Runtimes (June 2010)

A fully Direct3D 9-compatible system is required for the essential components to properly function.

Windows 2000 or above is required.

The supported game localizations are English, German, and French. Setup should automatically detect the appropriate language.

To install additional mods, you can use the included Dark Mod Manager. Alternatively, you can manually edit your mod paths in cam_mod.ini, located in the same directory as the game executable.

To uninstall or install additional components, simply run the patcher again and select the desired combination.

Do not set any compatibility modes on the game executable or install the game to a protected directory such as Program Files.

To install the game from the original CDs, check the box on the directory selection page and follow any additional instructions.
